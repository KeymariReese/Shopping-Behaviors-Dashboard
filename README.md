Overview

This project analyzes customer purchase behavior to uncover who is buying, how frequently they buy, and what drives spending, discounts, and subscriptions. The goal is to identify high-value segments, evaluate subscription and discount patterns, and inform marketing and inventory strategies.

The analysis combines transactional-level purchase data with demographic attributes, presented through:

Power BI dashboard (Shopping Behavior Dashboard.pbix), 
Summary presentation (Shopping Behavior & Purchase Patterns.pptx), 
Excel workbook (Shopping Behaviors.xlsx), 


Business Objectives

The analysis addresses key questions about customer behavior:

Which customer segments drive the most purchases and revenue?
How do discounts and promotions influence buying behavior across segments?
What are the purchase frequency patterns, and how do subscriptions impact repeat behavior?
How do demographic and seasonal factors affect spending?


Why this matters:
Enables targeted promotions to high-value and high-frequency customers, 
Prevents over-discounting of low-value segments, 
Optimizes inventory based on seasonal demand and demographic trends, 
Provides insights for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty
